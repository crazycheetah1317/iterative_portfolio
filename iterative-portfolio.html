            <h2>An exploration into iteration and user testing</h2>
            <h3>(Group project consisting of four members)</h3>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>The process of creating a satisfactory design is often a complex one. At a high level, designers create sketches,
                lofi wireframes, hifi prototypes, and at last a final product. Laid out this way, the process doesn’t seem so bad.
                But with each version comes multiple rounds - iterations - of work. Changes both big and small are fueled by
                feedback from the design team itself and outside users. In this project, we sought to familiarize
                ourselves with iterative design by creating an interactive mockup based on an active startup idea.</p>
            <p>For this project, the startup we chose to analyze was <b>Ole</b>. Ole is a shopping service that allows users to order online without worrying about whether clothes will fit or look
                good on them. Users input their zip code and view clothing items from various stores in the area. Thus, the clothes
                are not limited by brand or store. A personal shopper picks up the items and delivers them at a time that is determined by the user at checkout. While the driver waits, the user can try on each clothing item and select
                which ones to return or keep. The items they wish to return are given back to the driver, who completes the return
                process on the user’s behalf.</p>
            <p>Because of the delivery-based nature of the service, we decided to design for a desktop view. We imagine that most
                users will be on their computers when in the comfort of their own homes (or generally indoors), and thus would
                access Ole through those devices.</p>

                <h2>Sketches</h2>
                <p>We began the process by creating quick sketches of the core pages. The goal here was to explore a breadth of ideas.</p>

                <div id="image_box">

                            Cart. The Inspiration page was something we thought might be helpful for users: a way to view pre-existing
                            outfits and gain inspiration for one's own style.</p>
                        <p>Right: Additional sketches for the Inspiration page, which we considered a more unique page.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes</h2>
                <p>After reviewing our sketches, we refined our ideas into lofi wireframes. Core design decisions and/or functionalities are noted beneath each wireframe.</p>

                <div id="outer-wireframe-box">
                    <div class="wireframe-box">
                        <img src="source/Home.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
                        <p>A homepage consisting of a welcome message and a brief description of the service. Users can enter their zip
                            code to see which stores/clothing items are available nearby. A map at the bottom of the page updates when the
                            user enters a valid zip code.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="wireframe-box">
                        <img src="source/Cart.jpg" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
                        <p>A page displaying all the items a user has added to their cart. Basic information about each item (price, quantity, subtotal, size, and color) is displayed. A breakdown of the costs is shown to the right.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="wireframe-box">
                        <img src="source/Checkout.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
                        <p>A page that allows users to input their information for the order. The Order Summary box still appears to
                            remind users of what is generally in their order. They can return to the Cart page if they need more details, or
                            would like to edit their order. In a fully developed application, there would be a very similar page for billing
                            information.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="wireframe-box">
                        <img src="source/Return.jpg" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
                        <p>This is where users can choose which items to keep and which items to return. It is very similar to the Cart
                            page, but has checkboxes in lieu of the trash can icon. Checking the box associated with an item updates the
                            Return Summary box.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="wireframe-box">
                        <img src="source/Inspiration.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
                        <p>A Pinterest-style page that allows users to scroll through various outfits. If they find an outfit they like,
                            they can click on it to view the items in the outfit and/or "heart" it. There is also a scrollable side section
                            with suggested outfits based on the user's past likes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="wireframe-box">
                        <img src="source/Inspiration-2.jpg" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
                        <p>If a user clicks on an outfit, they are shown an enlarged image of the outfit, alongside the items in the
                            outfit. We debated having an "Add to Cart" button next to each item, but decided against it. To add an item to
                            cart, one would have to provide a size, color, and quantity, as well as be aware of the price. This was more
                            information than we thought would be wise to display. We decided it would be best to separate this functionality
                            and simply allow the user to navigate to an item's page by clicking on the image of it.</p>

                        <p>A simple order confirmation screen that lets the user know their purchase was successful. The button in the
                            middle of the screen takes the user to the next step in the process: choosing which items to return and accept.

                        <p>A page where people can choose what time they want their personal shopper to arrive with their items, as well as which shipping method they prefer. A map displays the address that the user previously inputted.</p>

                            of the screen takes the user back to the Shop page in case they want to follow up on their order.</p>

            <h2>Critique Feedback</h2>
            <div class="list">
         
                <h3>Overall & Miscellaneous</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep the same padding and margin across all pages. The buttons involved in the checkout process appear to
                        be in slightly different positions on different pages.</li>
                    <li>Keep the rounding of boxes and images consistent.</li>
                    <li>The navigation bar is not fully functional on all pages. Fixing this will help emulate the actual
                        experience of using the site more accurately.</li>
                    <li>The navigation bar in particular is a bit "jumpy" between pages.</li>
                    <li>A wishlist page might be helpful as a way to store liked items.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Browsing (Shopping) Page</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Placing filters at the top or left feels more intuitive.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Item Page</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a description for each item.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Checkout Page</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users cannot go back to the previous page while checking out, which is commonly supported and expected
                    functionality.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Shipping/Time Confirmation Page</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider offering ranges instead of specific times.</li>
                    <li>Strengthen the hierarchy. At the moment, numerous elements appear to be at the same level of hierarchy
                        when it seems like there should be an order.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Order Confirmation Page</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Show a summary of the items that were ordered.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="list">
                <p>Based on other feedback from critique, we improved our prototype in several ways:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Added the ability to go back to previous steps in the checkout process.
                <li>Standardized rounding and positioning of elements. In particular, the Summary sections and checkout-related
                    buttons are now all positioned in the same location.
                <li>The navbar is functional on all pages.
                <li>Added a wishlist page.
                <li>Altered the location of the filters on the Browse page.
                <li>Added a description for each clothing item.
                <li>Redesigned the Shipping/Time Confirmation page so that it has a clearer, more intuitive hierarchy. In
                    particular, text sizes are more clearly different. The page also offers time ranges instead of concrete times.

                <p>To iterate further, we had three professional user testers assess our prototype. The task that we provided and the accompanying feedback appear below.
                <h2>User testing tasks</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Imagine you are a shopper looking to use Ole to pick out a blue sweater for
                    the winter months. You already added a couple of items to the cart earlier today and are just looking to add
                    one more item. Please think out loud as you navigate the prototype from page to page. Please note that the
                    screens are not interactive; this interface is an interactive mockup made on prototyping software. This
                    means, for example, the buttons with links will take you from webpage to webpage but will not alter the
                    contents of the page you are on (e.g. if you click &lsquo;like&rsquo; on a clothing item the heart will not
                    change color). We are seeking feedback on the interaction, navigation, hierarchy, and intended
                    functionality.</p>

                    <h3>Navigation </h3>
                    <h4>1. Tester Feedback</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users enjoyed how most pages in the
                        checkout process showed what they ordered and thought checkout was fluid.</li>
                        <li>Two users navigated directly to the
                        Cart page instead of first looking at the Browse page.</li>
                        <li>One user assumed<span>&nbsp;that by clicking 'Submit', they would be sent to a final confirmation page before their order was placed. Maybe rename
                            &lsquo;Place Order&rsquo;.</li>
                        <li>Users were often confused about whether an item was added to the
                        cart.</li>
                        <li>Enjoyed Shopping page but wanted a number next to the cart icon indicating how many items they had added and wanted a popup
                        stating that the website was successfully updated.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>2. Potential Interface Changes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rename the &lsquo;Submit&rsquo; button to &lsquo;Place
                        Order&rsquo; so the user is more aware of what pressing the button does.</li>
                        <li>Confirmation message appears at top of screen when item is added
                        to cart and cart has number of items displayed as an icon.</li>
                        <li>Remove the navigation bar from the home page so that users know
                        that they are supposed to enter their zip code to enter rather than jump to other pages first.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
                    <h4>1. Tester Feedback</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confused about the keep/return functionality on the Return page.</li>
                        <li>Users wanted more ways to sort (e.g. by color) so that they could
                        find
                        the
                        blue sweater quicker.</li>
                        <li>Confused about how to select times on the Shipping
                        Confirmation
                        page but liked that they could pick when the item would be delivered.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>2. Potential Interface Changes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make the buttons on the Shipping Confirmation page look more similar to
                        other buttons on the website and have more affordances (e.g. darken when hovering) so that
                        people
                        know
                        they can push them.</li>
                        <li>Remove the keep button on the Return page so that people
                        aren&rsquo;t confused by that functionality. Consider replacing the keep/return buttons with simple checkboxes.</li>
                        <li>Add filters.</li>
                    </ul>
             
                    <h3>Functionality</h3>
                    <h4>1. Tester Feedback</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Thought website was a base prototype for shopping companies
                        based on home page.</li>
                        <li>Liked the front page but didn&rsquo;t like the word frictionless<span class="c1">&nbsp;&mdash;
                            liked
                            how
                            it
                            gave an introduction to the website.</li>
                        <li>Wish the page didn&rsquo;t make you select options in order on the
                        return page. The process was easy once that requirement was made clear.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>2. Potential Interface Changes</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make the Return page operate so you do not have to choose which
                        items to keep/return in sequential order. (This was our intent, but we were unable to capture the full functionality in Figma.)</li>
                        <li>Make it more clear on the homepage what the purpose of the
                        startup is.</li>
                    </ul>

        <h1 style="padding-top:2rem;">Part 4: Conclusion and Takeaways</h1>

        <div class="image_box">
            <div class="list">
                <p>As a group, we learned that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Consistency goes a long way in a design. Inconsistencies with styling and placement can draw users' attention away from the content itself.
                  <li>Different users may feel differently about the same aspect of a design. Sometimes, there is no clear-cut answer, and it is up to the designers to make the final call.
                  <li>Getting attached to a particular design is not the answer. Even after iterating, users may have critiques about parts of the design that the development team thought were intuitive. Designers must be willing to listen and adapt.
                </ul>

                <p>Previously, I had only had experience working through the individual design process, mainly part 1 of this project so it was insightful to be able to learn about the revision process in doing this project.
                    My favorite part of this project was the mockup critique session where we were able to get feedback on our prototype and again when we got feedback from the user testing portion. I learned that simplicity and consistency, as well as attention
                    to detail, are essential in creating the most practical products.
